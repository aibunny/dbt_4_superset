# Smartcollect-lineage

Installation

```bash
pip install smartcollect-lineage
```

## Usage

`dbt-superset-lineage` comes with a few basic commands: `pull-dashboards`, create-dashboards, create-db,  `push-metrics` and `push-descriptions `. The documentation for the individual commands can be shown by using the `--help` option.

It includes a wrapper for [Superset API](https://superset.apache.org/docs/rest-api), one only needs to provide
`SUPERSET_ACCESS_TOKEN`/`SUPERSET_REFRESH_TOKEN` (obtained via `/security/login`)
as environment variable or through `--superset-access-token`/`superset-refresh-token` option.

**N.B.**

- Make sure to run `dbt compile` (or `dbt run`) against the production profile, not your development profile
- In case more databases are used within dbt and/or Superset and there are duplicate names (`schema + table`) across
  them, specify the database through `--dbt-db-name` and/or `--superset-db-id` options
- Currently, `PUT` requests are only supported if CSRF tokens are disabled in Superset (`WTF_CSRF_ENABLED=False`).
- Tested on dbt v1.4.5 and Apache Superset v2.0.1. Other versions might face errors due to different underlying code and API.

### Pull dashboards

Pull dashboards from Superset and add them as
[exposures](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/exposures/) to dbt docs with
references to dbt sources and models, making them visible both separately and as dependencies.

**N.B.**

- Only published dashboards are extracted.

```console
$ cd jaffle_shop
$ dbt compile  # Compile project to create manifest.json
$ export SUPERSET_ACCESS_TOKEN=<TOKEN>
$ smartcollect-lineage pull-dashboards https://mysuperset.mycompany.com  # Pull dashboards from Superset to /models/exposures/superset_dashboards.yml
$ dbt docs generate # Generate dbt docs
$ dbt docs serve # Serve dbt docs
```

### Push descriptions

Push model and column descriptions and labels from your dbt docs to Superset as plain text so that they could be viewed
in Superset when creating charts.

**N.B.**:

- Run carefully as this rewrites your datasets using merged metadata from Superset and dbt docs.
- Running with `--superset-refresh-columns` overrides `columns.filterable` and `columns.groupby` to `true`,
  because of [this issue](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/24136).
- Descriptions are rendered as plain text, hence no markdown syntax, incl. links, will be displayed.
- Avoid special characters and strings in your dbt docs, e.g. `â†’` or `<null>`.

```console
$ cd jaffle_shop
$ dbt compile  # Compile project to create manifest.json
$ export SUPERSET_ACCESS_TOKEN=<TOKEN>
$ smartc-lineage push-descriptions https://mysuperset.mycompany.com  # Push descrptions from dbt docs to Superset
```

## Create DB

This command creates a database on superset and it's associated datasets which should be available on the specified schema

USAGE: 

this command takes requires the superset instance url and an env file path containing the database credentials and details as shown in [env sample](.env.sample)

```bash
smartcollect-lineage create-db https://dash.lab.co.ke  /home/aibunny/crafted/lineage/dbt-4-superset/.env

```

## Push metrics

This command pushes metrics from dbt to superset 

USAGE:

* The command requires the superset instance url and the dbt project path

```bash
smartcollect-lineage push-metrics https://dash.lab.co.ke  --dbt-project-dir /home/aibunny/crafted/dbt/dbt-smartcollect-pro/

```

**NB:**

* This command assumes that all metrics have been tested and should be used with caution since it takes an unconventional approach requiring you to create the metrics on your model description on dbt in this format. Ensure the `expressions` are in Upper Case SQL format as superset runs into errors when done differently

```yaml

 meta:
      superset_metrics:
        - name: Total Files
          label: Total Files
          expression: COUNT(id)
          type: count

        - name: Total Principal
          label: Total Principal
          expression: SUM(principal_amount)
          type: sum

        - name: Total Arrears
          label: Total Arrears
          expression: SUM(arrears)
          type: sum

        - name: Total Balance
          label: Total Balance
          expression: SUM(balance)
          type: sum
```

## Create Dashboards

This command creates dashboards on superset 

Usage:

* The command expects the url for the superset instance, the `.env` file path which should contain the db URI as in [.env.sample](.env.sample) and the location to where the dashboards to be created are

```bash
create-dashboard https://dash.lab.co.ke  /home/aibunny/crafted/lineage/smartcollect-lineage/.env /home/aibunny/Downloads/

```

**NB:**

* Ensure that all dashboards are in the same directory

## Initiate

This command runs all the above commands in this order:

```bash
>>create-db
>>push-metrics
>>push-descriptions
>>create-dashboards

```

Usage:

The command takes in the `.env` file path which should contain all values show in [.env.sample](.env.sample)

```bash
smartcollect-linage initiate /home/aibunny/.env
```
